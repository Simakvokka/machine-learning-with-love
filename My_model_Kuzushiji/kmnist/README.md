## News and Updates
**IMPORTANT** If you downloaded the KMNIST and K49 datasets before **5 February 2019**, please kindly download the dataset and run your code again. We fixed minor bugs due to image processing and it might slightly change the result number. Thank you for your coorporation.

## The Dataset

**Kuzushiji-MNIST** is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format. Since MNIST restricts us to 10 classes, we chose one character to represent each of the 10 rows of Hiragana when creating Kuzushiji-MNIST.

**Kuzushiji-49**, as the name suggests, has 49 classes (28x28 grayscale, 270,912 images), is a much larger, but imbalanced dataset containing 48 Hiragana characters and one Hiragana iteration mark.

**Kuzushiji-Kanji** is an imbalanced dataset of total 3832 Kanji characters (64x64 grayscale, 140,426 images), ranging from 1,766 examples to only a single example per class.

### Kuzushiji-MNIST

Kuzushiji-MNIST contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images spanning 10 classes (one from each column of [hiragana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Table_hiragana.svg/768px-Table_hiragana.svg.png)), and is perfectly balanced like the original MNIST dataset (6k/1k train/test for each class).

Mapping from class indices to characters: [kmnist_classmap.csv](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kmnist/kmnist_classmap.csv) (1KB)

We recommend using standard top-1 accuracy on the test set for evaluating on Kuzushiji-MNIST.

##### Which format do I download?
If you're looking for a drop-in replacement for the MNIST or Fashion-MNIST dataset (for tools that currently work with these datasets), download the data in MNIST format.

Otherwise, it's recommended to download in NumPy format, which can be loaded into an array as easy as:  
`arr = np.load(filename)['arr_0']`.

### Kuzushiji-49

Kuzushiji-49 contains 270,912 images spanning 49 classes, and is an extension of the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset.

We recommend using balanced accuracy on the test set for evaluating on Kuzushiji-49.

### Kuzushiji-Kanji

Kuzushiji-Kanji is a large and highly imbalanced 64x64 dataset of 3832 Kanji characters, containing 140,426 images of both common and rare characters.  

The full dataset is available for download [here](http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kkanji/kkanji.tar) (310MB).  
We plan to release a train/test split version as a low-shot learning dataset very soon.

For MNIST and Kuzushiji-MNIST we use a standard accuracy metric, while Kuzushiji-49 is evaluated using balanced accuracy (so that all classes have equal weight).
